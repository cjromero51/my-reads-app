# MyReads Project

The project should allow you to move books from the provided database onto different virtual shelves (Currently Reading, Want to Read, or Read) as well as remove books from the shelves entirely.

The project should allow you to successfully search for books when using the provided [Search Terms](SEARCH_TERMS.md) and add/remove them to/from your bookcase.

## Requirements
* npm

## How to Run:
[Download](https://github.com/cjromero51/my-reads-app.git) or [Clone](https://github.com/cjromero51/my-reads-app.git) the Repository.


Run ```npm install```.


Run the app using ```npm start```.


If your browser doesn't automatically open a new tab, the app can be seen at: localhost:3000.


## Backend Server

To simplify your development process, we've provided a backend server for you to develop against. The provided file [`BooksAPI.js`](src/BooksAPI.js) contains the methods you will need to perform necessary operations on the backend:

* [`getAll`](#getall)
* [`update`](#update)
* [`search`](#search)

### `getAll`

Method Signature:

```js
getAll()
```

* Returns a Promise which resolves to a JSON object containing a collection of book objects.
* This collection represents the books currently in the bookshelves in your app.

### `update`

Method Signature:

```js
update(book, shelf)
```

* book: `<Object>` containing at minimum an `id` attribute
* shelf: `<String>` contains one of ["wantToRead", "currentlyReading", "read"]  
* Returns a Promise which resolves to a JSON object containing the response data of the POST request

### `search`

Method Signature:

```js
search(query)
```

* query: `<String>`
* Returns a Promise which resolves to a JSON object containing a collection of a maximum of 20 book objects.
* These books do not know which shelf they are on. They are raw results only. You'll need to make sure that books have the correct state while on the search page.

## Important
The backend API uses a fixed set of cached search results and is limited to a particular set of search terms, which can be found in [SEARCH_TERMS.md](SEARCH_TERMS.md). That list of terms are the _only_ terms that will work with the backend, so don't be surprised if your searches for Basket Weaving or Bubble Wrap don't come back with any results.
